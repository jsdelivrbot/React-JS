# ReactJS 
React is front end library developed by Facebook. It's used for handling view layer for web and mobile apps. ReactJS allows us to create reusable UI components.

### Features
JSX − JSX is JavaScript syntax extension. It isn't necessary to use JSX in React development, but it is recommended.

Components − React is all about components. You need to think of everything as a component. This will help you to maintain the code when working on larger scale projects.

Unidirectional data flow and Flux − React implements one way data flow which makes it easy to reason about your app. Flux is a pattern that helps keeping your data unidirectional.

### React Advantages
- React uses virtual DOM which is JavaScript object. This will improve apps performance since JavaScript virtual DOM is faster than the regular DOM.
- React can be used on client and server side.
- Component and Data patterns improve readability which helps to maintain larger apps.
- React can be used with other frameworks.

### React Limitations
- React only covers view layer of the app so you still need to choose other technologies to get a complete tooling set for development.
- React is using inline templating and JSX. This can seem awkward to some developers.
